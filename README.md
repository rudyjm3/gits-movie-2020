# Ghost in The Shell Movie (2017) Website Design
## Over View

Create a website for the live action movie "Ghost in The Shell" that was released in 2017. The site is to have the look a movie production studio would put out before a movie's release date with trailers of the movie, and image gallery. Also needs to have elements that the site would have once the movie is available for retail purchase, renting, and streaming.  

(Project initially started in 2020)
Initially the website was suppose to be kinda like a fansite. Going over what Ghost in The Shell is and contnet thats been created around it like the anime movies, anime series, video games and a time line of the movies/shows when they came out.
